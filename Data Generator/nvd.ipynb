Starting in version 0.6.1 and prior to version 0.7.0, if a KernelSU installed device is infected with a malware whose app signing block specially constructed, it can take over root privileges on the device. The vulnerable verification logic actually obtains the signature of the last block with an id of `0x7109871a`, while the verification logic during Android installation is to obtain the first one. In addition to the actual signature upgrade that has been fixed (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V3), there is also the problem of actual signature downgrading (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V1). Find a condition in the signature verification logic that will cause the signature not to be found error, and KernelSU does not implement the same conditions, so KSU thinks there is a V2 signature, but the APK signature verification actually uses the V1 signature. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.0. As workarounds, keep the KernelSU manager installed and avoid installing unknown apps.\n",

The error makes it impossible to display the affected chat history, other conversations are not affected. The issue has been fixed in version 2022-11-02 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-11-02-production.0-v0.31.9-0-337e400 or wire-server 2022-11-03 (chart/4.26.0), so that their applications are no longer affected. As a workaround, you may use an iOS or Android client and delete the corresponding message from the history OR write 30 or more messages into the affected conversation to prevent the client from further rendering of the corresponding message. When attempting to retrieve messages from the conversation history, the error will continue to occur once the malformed message is part of the result.\n",

The Tasks.org app uses the activity `ShareLinkActivity.kt` to handle \"share\" intents coming from other components in the same device and convert them to tasks. Those intents may contain arbitrary file paths as attachments, in which case the files pointed by those paths are copied in the app's external storage directory. Prior to versions 12.7.1 and 13.0.1, those paths were not validated, allowing a malicious or compromised application in the same device to force Tasks.org to copy files from its internal storage to its external storage directory, where they became accessible to any component with permission to read the external storage. This vulnerability can lead to sensitive information disclosure. All information in the user's notes and the app's preferences, including the encrypted credentials of CalDav integrations if enabled, could be accessed by third party applications installed on the same device. This issue was fixed in versions 12.7.1 and 13.0.1. There are no known workarounds.\n",

      "Description: matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key, spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.\n",

Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the key forwarding strategy implemented in the matrix-android-sdk2 that is too permissive. Starting with version 1.5.1, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-android-sdk2. The matrix-android-sdk2 will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages). As a workaroubnd, current users of the SDK can disable key forwarding in their forks using `CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`.\n",

      "Description: cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio is a plugin provides a single and simple interface for accessing fingerprint APIs on both Android 6+ and iOS. In versions prior to 5.0.1 The exported activity `de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity` can cause the app to crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't handle the case where it is requested with invalid or empty data which results in a crash. Any third party app can constantly call this activity with no permission. A 3rd party app/attacker using event listener can continually stop the app from working and make the victim unable to open it. Version 5.0.1 of the cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio doesn't export the activity anymore and is no longer vulnerable. If you want to fix older versions change the attribute android:exported in plugin.xml to false. Please upgrade to version 5.0.1 as soon as possible.\n",

We are updating the list of fixed releases and adding the Software Checker. Our investigation has determined that the actors exploited two previously unknown issues. The attacker first exploited CVE-2023-20198 to gain initial access and issued a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password combination. This allowed the user to log in with normal user access. The attacker then exploited another component of the web UI feature, leveraging the new local user to elevate privilege to root and write the implant to the file system. Cisco has assigned CVE-2023-20273 to this issue. CVE-2023-20198 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 10.0. CVE-2023-20273 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 7.2.

This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when certain conditions are met during the AP joining process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by adding an AP that is under their control to the network. The attacker then must ensure that the AP successfully joins an affected wireless controller under certain conditions. Additionally, the attacker would need the ability to restart a valid AP that was previously connected to the controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.\n",

This vulnerability is due to errors that occur when retrieving the public release key that is used for image signature verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying specific variables in the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash memory of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying operating system. Note: In Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and later, the complexity of an attack using this vulnerability is high. However, an attacker with level-15 privileges could easily downgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software on a device to a release that would lower the attack complexity.\n",

This vulnerability is due to an improper check in the code function that manages the verification of the digital signatures of system image files during the initial boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification check part of the boot process of the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs either unauthenticated physical access to the device or privileged access to the root shell on the device. Note: In Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and later, root shell access is protected by the Consent Token mechanism. However, an attacker with level-15 privileges could easily downgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software running on a device to a release where root shell access is more readily available.\n",

      "Description: Matrix iOS SDK allows developers to build iOS apps compatible with Matrix. Prior to version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-ios-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy. The default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19. matrix-ios-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages). This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.\n",

      "Description: Matrix iOS SDK allows developers to build iOS apps compatible with Matrix. Prior to version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround. To avoid malicious backup attacks, one should not verify one's new logins using emoji/QR verifications methods until patched.\n",

This vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must control a BGP speaker that has an established trusted peer connection to an affected device that is configured with the address family L2VPN EVPN to receive and process the update message. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by any data that is initiated by clients on the Layer 2 network or by peers that are not configured to accept the L2VPN EVPN address family. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP updates only from explicitly defined peers. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the malicious BGP update message must either come from a configured, valid BGP peer or be injected by the attacker into the affected BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.\n",

It incorrectly renders RTLO encoded URLs beginning with a non-breaking space, when there is a hash character in the URL. This technique allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send legitimate looking links, appearing to be any website URL, by abusing the non-http/non-https automatic rendering of URLs. An attacker can spoof, for example, example.com, and masquerade any URL with a malicious destination. An attacker requires a subdomain such as gepj, txt, fdp, or xcod, which would appear backwards as jpeg, txt, pdf, and docx respectively.\n",

In versions prior to 5.0.1 The exported activity `de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity` can cause the app to crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't handle the case where it is requested with invalid or empty data which results in a crash. Any third party app can constantly call this activity with no permission. A 3rd party app/attacker using event listener can continually stop the app from working and make the victim unable to open it. Version 5.0.1 of the cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio doesn't export the activity anymore and is no longer vulnerable.

      "Description: An issue was discovered in TrEEConfigDriver in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. It can report false TPM PCR values, and thus mask malware activity. Devices use Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) to record information about device and software configuration to ensure that the boot process is secure. (For example, Windows uses these PCR measurements to determine device health.) A vulnerable device can masquerade as a healthy device by extending arbitrary values into Platform Configuration Register (PCR) banks. This requires physical access to a target victim's device, or compromise of user credentials for a device. This issue is similar to CVE-2021-42299 (on Surface Pro devices).\n",

The endpoint accepts the parameter `serverImagePath`, which is not sanitized in any way before being passed to `System.IO.File.OpenRead`, which results in an arbitrary file read. This issue may lead to an arbitrary file read which is exacerbated in the windows installer which installs the ShokoServer as administrator. Any unauthenticated attacker may be able to access sensitive information and read files stored on the server. The `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint has been removed in commit `6c57ba0f0` which will be included in subsequent releases. Users should limit access to the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint or manually patch their installations until a patched release is made. This issue was discovered by the GitHub Security lab and is also indexed as GHSL-2023-191.\n",

      "Description: yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. yt-dlp allows the user to provide shell command lines to be executed at various stages in its download steps through the `--exec` flag. This flag allows output template expansion in its argument, so that metadata values may be used in the shell commands. The metadata fields can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended to quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell. However, the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows) does not properly escape special characters, which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec` is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special character. `\\n` will be replaced by `\\r` as no way of escaping it has been found. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using --exec, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade: 1. Avoid using any output template expansion in --exec other than {} (filepath). 2. If expansion in --exec is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain \", | or &. 3. Instead of using --exec, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.\n",

This can be exploited for remote code execution (RCE), for instance if the file written outside the working tree is a git filter that gets executed on a subsequent git command.The issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The user performing the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git configuration.Setting git configuration option core.symlinks = false before checking out avoids the problem.The issue was fixed in Eclipse JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via  Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/  and  repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ .The JGit maintainers would like to thank RyotaK for finding and reporting this issue.\n",

      "Description: Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementationcontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on theWindows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64 processors supporting theAVX512-IFMA instructions.Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attackercan influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the applicationstate might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL doesnot save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platformwhen calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning tothe caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring theirprevious content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processorssupporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized sothe attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependentcalculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEADcipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications usingOpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware ofany concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore weconsider this a Low severity security issue.As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled atruntime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap:   OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.\n",

      "Description:  GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. When resolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working directory, and after that the PATH environment. GitPython defaults to use the `git` command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo has a `git.exe` or `git` executable, that program will be run instead of the one in the user's `PATH`. This is more of a problem on how Python interacts with Windows systems, Linux and any other OS aren't affected by this. But probably people using GitPython usually run it from the CWD of a repo. An attacker can trick a user to download a repository with a malicious `git` executable, if the user runs/imports GitPython from that directory, it allows the attacker to run any arbitrary commands. There is no fix currently available for windows users, however there are a few mitigations. 1: Default to an absolute path for the git program on Windows, like `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\cmd\\\\git.EXE` (default git path installation). 2: Require users to set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variable on Windows systems. 3: Make this problem prominent in the documentation and advise users to never run GitPython from an untrusted repo, or set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` env var to an absolute path. 4: Resolve the executable manually by only looking into the `PATH` environment variable.\n",

The files are created and written with a SYSTEM account except one file (logplaceholder) which inherits permission giving all users full access control list. Netskope client restricts access to this file by allowing only read permissions as a standard user. Whenever the Netskope client service restarts, it deletes the logplaceholder and recreates, creating a race condition, which can be exploited by a malicious local user to create the file and set ACL permissions on the file. Once the file is created by a malicious user with proper ACL permissions, all files within C:\\Users\\Public\\netSkope\\ becomes modifiable by the unprivileged user. By using Windows pseudo-symlink, these files can be pointed to other places in the system and thus malicious users will be able to elevate privileges.\n",

      "Description: Ombi is an open source application which allows users to request specific media from popular self-hosted streaming servers. Versions prior to 4.38.2 contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability where an Ombi administrative user may access files available to the Ombi server process on the host operating system. Ombi administrators may not always be local system administrators and so this may violate the security expectations of the system. The arbitrary file read vulnerability was present in `ReadLogFile` and `Download` endpoints in `SystemControllers.cs` as the parameter `logFileName` is not sanitized before being combined with the `Logs` directory. When using `Path.Combine(arg1, arg2, arg3)`, an attacker may be able to escape to folders/files outside of `Path.Combine(arg1, arg2)` by using \"..\" in `arg3`. In addition, by specifying an absolute path for `arg3`, `Path.Combine` will completely ignore the first two arguments and just return just `arg3`. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure. The Ombi `documentation` suggests running Ombi as a Service with Administrator privileges. An attacker targeting such an application may be able to read the files of any Windows user on the host machine and certain system files. This issue has been addressed in commit `b8a8f029` and in release version 4.38.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2023-088.\n",

The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders.

      "Description: In Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, no localized messages are shipped with the installer. As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function's implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.This vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`.\n",

      "Description: An unprivileged (non-admin) user can exploit an Improper Access Control vulnerability in the Cloudflare WARP Client for Windows (<= 2022.12.582.0) to perform privileged operations with SYSTEM context by working with a combination of opportunistic locks (oplock) and symbolic links (which can both be created by an unprivileged user).After installing the Cloudflare WARP Client (admin privileges required), an MSI-Installer is placed under C:\\Windows\\Installer. The vulnerability lies in the repair function of this MSI.ImpactAn unprivileged (non-admin) user can exploit this vulnerability to perform privileged operations with SYSTEM context, including deleting arbitrary files and reading arbitrary file content. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including the manipulation of system files and privilege escalation.PatchesA new installer with a fix that addresses this vulnerability was released in version 2023.3.381.0. While the WARP Client itself is not vulnerable (only the installer), users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version and delete any older installers present in their systems.\n",

Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.\n",

      "Description: Git GUI is a convenient graphical tool that comes with Git for Windows. Its target audience is users who are uncomfortable with using Git on the command-line. Git GUI has a function to clone repositories. Immediately after the local clone is available, Git GUI will automatically post-process it, among other things running a spell checker called `aspell.exe` if it was found. Git GUI is implemented as a Tcl/Tk script. Due to the unfortunate design of Tcl on Windows, the search path when looking for an executable _always includes the current directory_. Therefore, malicious repositories can ship with an `aspell.exe` in their top-level directory which is executed by Git GUI without giving the user a chance to inspect it first, i.e. running untrusted code. This issue has been addressed in version 2.39.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using Git GUI for cloning. If that is not a viable option, at least avoid cloning from untrusted sources.\n",

Starting with version 1.7.0 and prior to versions 1.18.4, 1.20.3, and 1.23.1, when configuring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previously configured `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this effectively undoes the configuration. Remote clients may only access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publicly shared folder (SMB). Versions 1.23.1, 1.20.3, and 1.18.4 have been patched. The fix will also be present in all releases starting from version 1.24.0. Named pipes were introduced to Tokio in version 1.7.0, so releases older than 1.7.0 are not affected. As a workaround, ensure that `pipe_mode` is set first after initializing a `ServerOptions`.\n",

      "Description: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with your computer. In version 3.6.0, if a user received a malicious file share and has it synced locally or the virtual filesystem enabled and clicked a nc://open/ link it will open the default editor for the file type of the shared file, which on Windows can also sometimes mean that a file depending on the type, e.g. \"vbs\", is being executed. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to version 3.6.1. As a workaround, users can block the Nextcloud Desktop client 3.6.0 by setting the `minimum.supported.desktop.version` system config to `3.6.1` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing files can still be used. Another workaround would be to enforce shares to be accepted by setting the `sharing.force_share_accept` system config to `true` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing shares can still be abused.\n",

      "Description: Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. In versions prior to 1.0.7 and 1.1.2, Tauri is vulnerable to an Incorrectly-Resolved Name. Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality, it is possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope definition. It is not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths, as the issue is limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed paths. The impact differs on Windows, MacOS and Linux due to different specifications of valid path characters. This bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files, as user selected paths are automatically added to the allow list at runtime. A successful bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files. The issue has been patched in versions 1.0.7, 1.1.2 and 1.2.0. As a workaround, disable the dialog and fileDropEnabled component inside the tauri.conf.json.\n",

In versions prior to 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7, Electron is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information. When following a redirect, Electron delays a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes. The contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as `file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect to that server and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include sending hashed credentials.This issue has been patched in versions: 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7. Users are recommended to upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on('will-redirect')` event, for all WebContents as a workaround.\n",

      "Description: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository, Poetry executes various commands, e.g. `git config`. These commands are being executed using the executable’s name and not its absolute path. This can lead to the execution of untrusted code due to the way Windows resolves executable names to paths. Unlike Linux-based operating systems, Windows searches for the executable in the current directory first and looks in the paths that are defined in the `PATH` environment variable afterward. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which would lead to the takeover of the system. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe. The victim could also not protect themself by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory, because the behavior is undocumented. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n",

An unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765, for example when navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them, but where an attacker could create a git repository. Versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5 contain a patch for this issue. The simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described in the example is to avoid running git as root (or an Administrator in Windows), and if needed to reduce its use to a minimum. While a generic workaround is not possible, a system could be hardened from the exploit described in the example by removing any such repository if it exists already and creating one as root to block any future attacks.\n",

      "Description: A program using swift-corelibs-foundation is vulnerable to a denial of service attack caused by a potentially malicious source producing a JSON document containing a type mismatch. This vulnerability is caused by the interaction between a deserialization mechanism offered by the Swift standard library, the Codable protocol; and the JSONDecoder class offered by swift-corelibs-foundation, which can deserialize types that adopt the Codable protocol based on the content of a provided JSON document. When a type that adopts Codable requests the initialization of a field with an integer value, the JSONDecoder class uses a type-erased container with different accessor methods to attempt and coerce a corresponding JSON value and produce an integer. In the case the JSON value was a numeric literal with a floating-point portion, JSONDecoder used different type-eraser methods during validation than it did during the final casting of the value. The checked casting produces a deterministic crash due to this mismatch. The JSONDecoder class is often wrapped by popular Swift-based web frameworks to parse the body of HTTP requests and perform basic type validation. This makes the attack low-effort: sending a specifically crafted JSON document during a request to these endpoints will cause them to crash. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself; the crash is produced deterministically by an abort function that ensures that execution does not continue in the face of this violation of assumptions. However, unexpected crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it's possible that this attack can be used to trigger error conditions that escalate the risk. Producing a denial of service may also be the goal of an attacker in itself. This issue is solved in Swift 5.6.2 for Linux and Windows. This issue was solved by ensuring that the same methods are invoked both when validating and during casting, so that no type mismatch occurs. Swift for Linux and Windows versions are not ABI-interchangeable. To upgrade a service, its owner must update to this version of the Swift toolchain, then recompile and redeploy their software. The new version of Swift includes an updated swift-corelibs-foundation package. Versions of Swift running on Darwin-based operating systems are not affected.\n",

      "Description: An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to missing integrity checks, an attacker can manipulate the content of the emulated CD-ROM drive (containing the Windows and macOS client software). The content of this emulated CD-ROM drive is stored as an ISO-9660 image in the hidden sectors of the USB drive, that can only be accessed using special IOCTL commands, or when installing the drive in an external disk enclosure. By manipulating this ISO-9660 image or replacing it with another one, an attacker is able to store malicious software on the emulated CD-ROM drive. This software may get executed by an unsuspecting victim when using the device. For example, an attacker with temporary physical access during the supply chain could program a modified ISO-9660 image on a device that always accepts an attacker-controlled password for unlocking the device. If the attacker later on gains access to the used USB drive, he can simply decrypt all contained user data. Storing arbitrary other malicious software is also possible.

      "Description: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n",

      "Description: On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a `..exe` file as well as a file named `git.exe`, and `git.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affect Unix systems. Similarly, if the malicious repository contains files named `..exe` and `cygpath.exe`, and `cygpath.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed when certain Git LFS commands are run. More generally, if the current working directory contains any file with a base name of `.` and a file extension from `PATHEXT` (except `.bat` and `.cmd`), and also contains another file with the same base name as a program Git LFS intends to execute (such as `git`, `cygpath`, or `uname`) and any file extension from `PATHEXT` (including `.bat` and `.cmd`), then, on Windows, when Git LFS attempts to execute the intended program the `..exe`, `..com`, etc., file will be executed instead, but only if the intended program is not found in any directory listed in `PATH`. The vulnerability occurs because when Git LFS detects that the program it intends to run does not exist in any directory listed in `PATH` then Git LFS passes an empty string as the executable file path to the Go `os/exec` package, which contains a bug such that, on Windows, it prepends the name of the current working directory (i.e., `.`) to the empty string without adding a path separator, and as a result searches in that directory for a file with the base name `.` combined with any file extension from `PATHEXT`, executing the first one it finds. (The reason `..bat` and `..cmd` files are not executed in the same manner is that, although the Go `os/exec` package tries to execute them just as it does a `..exe` file, the Microsoft Win32 API `CreateProcess()` family of functions have an undocumented feature in that they apparently recognize when a caller is attempting to execute a batch script file and instead run the `cmd.exe` command interpreter, passing the full set of command line arguments as parameters. These are unchanged from the command line arguments set by Git LFS, and as such, the intended program's name is the first, resulting in a command line like `cmd.exe /c git`, which then fails.) Git LFS has resolved this vulnerability by always reporting an error when a program is not found in any directory listed in `PATH` rather than passing an empty string to the Go `os/exec` package in this case. The bug in the Go `os/exec` package has been reported to the Go project and is expected to be patched after this security advisory is published. The problem was introduced in version 2.12.1 and is patched in version 3.1.3. Users of affected versions should upgrade to version 3.1.3. There are currently no known workarounds at this time.\n",

      "Description: Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`.\n",

An attacker with the ability to create or modify CiliumNetworkPolicy objects in a particular namespace is able to affect traffic on an entire Cilium cluster, potentially bypassing policy enforcement in other namespaces. By using a crafted `endpointSelector` that uses the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init` label, the attacker can create policies that bypass namespace restrictions and affect the entire Cilium cluster. This includes potentially allowing or denying all traffic. This attack requires API server access, as described in the Kubernetes API Server Attacker section of the Cilium Threat Model. This issue has been resolved in Cilium versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14. As a workaround an admission webhook can be used to prevent the use of `endpointSelectors` that use the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init` label in CiliumNetworkPolicies.\n",

In Cilium clusters where Cilium's Layer 7 proxy has been disabled, creating workloads with `policy.cilium.io/proxy-visibility` annotations (in Cilium >= v1.13) or `io.cilium.proxy-visibility` annotations (in Cilium <= v1.12) causes the Cilium agent to segfault on the node to which the workload is assigned. Existing traffic on the affected node will continue to flow, but the Cilium agent on the node will not able to process changes to workloads running on the node. This will also prevent workloads from being able to start on the affected node. The denial of service will be limited to the node on which the workload is scheduled, however an attacker may be able to schedule workloads on the node of their choosing, which could lead to targeted attacks. This issue has been resolved in Cilium versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14. Users unable to upgrade can avoid this denial of service attack by enabling the Layer 7 proxy.\n",

      "Description: Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. An attacker with the ability to update pod labels can cause Cilium to apply incorrect network policies. This issue arises due to the fact that on pod update, Cilium incorrectly uses user-provided pod labels to select the policies which apply to the workload in question. This can affect Cilium network policies that use the namespace, service account or cluster constructs to restrict traffic, Cilium clusterwide network policies that use Cilium namespace labels to select the Pod and Kubernetes network policies. Non-existent construct names can be provided, which bypass all network policies applicable to the construct. For example, providing a pod with a non-existent namespace as the value of the `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` label results in none of the namespaced CiliumNetworkPolicies applying to the pod in question. This attack requires the attacker to have Kubernetes API Server access, as described in the Cilium Threat Model. This issue has been resolved in: Cilium versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14. Users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround an admission webhook can be used to prevent pod label updates to the `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` and `io.cilium.k8s.policy.*` keys.\n",

In version 1.13.0, when Cilium is started, there is a short period when Cilium eBPF programs are not attached to the host. During this period, the host does not implement any of Cilium's featureset. This can cause disruption to newly established connections during this period due to the lack of Load Balancing, or can cause Network Policy bypass due to the lack of Network Policy enforcement during the window. This vulnerability impacts any Cilium-managed endpoints on the node (such as Kubernetes Pods), as well as the host network namespace (including Host Firewall). This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium 1.13.1 or later. Cilium releases 1.12.x, 1.11.x, and earlier are not affected. There are no known workarounds.\n",

Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy.
