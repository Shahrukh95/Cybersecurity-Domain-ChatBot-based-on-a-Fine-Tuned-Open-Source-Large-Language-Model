This is achieved by incorporating the 'X-Graylog-No-Session-Extension:true' header in the request, thereby disabling the session's capacity to renew. This risk period continues until the session officially expires according to the predefined timeout settings that take effect post-logout."

An attacker devises a strategy to compromise the site by crafting an email directed at this user, which contains a deceptive hyperlink leading to a harmful website. If the unsuspecting administrator were to click on this link, they would be taken to a webpage that executes a covert script. This script, in turn, initiates a request targeting the 'Find and Replace All' plugin's functionality for string modification. The critical flaw here is that the plugin lacks a mechanism to confirm that the request originated from a legitimate user action, as it does not implement a CSRF token verification. The absence of this security check allows the attacker to modify essential aspects of the website, such as the site's URL or the admin login credentials.
